The MMD portfolio allows users to present their portfolio of work in a clear, visual manner. Features hover and filter animations. 

== Description == 
This plugin adds the MMD Portfolios tab to the Wordpress admin panel. In this tab, you can create and manage portfolios of any kind of item you like. The portfolio will be presented as a clear, customisable grid of images, which includes a filter menu. There are animations included for when a filter is selected, as well as for when an item is hovered. In fact, the hover overlay follows your mouse around to really give the feel of a complete portfolio rather than just a group of individual items. All portfolios generated are fully responsive for all screen sizes. All in all, the MMD Portfolio is a highly customisable, easy to use and beautiful way to present your work to your audience. We offer a full version without functional limitations completely for free.

5. All done? Press the blue "publish" button on the right side of your screen to save your portfolio!
6. In the "All MMD Portfolios" tab, you will see your new portfolio, with a shortcode displayed to the right. Insert that wherever you like in your post or page, and your portfolio will be generated there.
